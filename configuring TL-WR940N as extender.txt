1. 	Under LAN, change ip address of the extender to not have any conflicts with parent router / dhcp server . Disable IGMP
	e.g.  from http://192.168.0.1 to http://192.168.0.2
	restart device


2.	Use new IP to log into extender console. In wireless settings, enable wds mode and survey for primary router and give those credentials


3.	disable dhcp, give default gateway as primary router (e.g.  from http://192.168.0.2 (self) to http://192.168.0.1) and 
	restarts device.
	After restart, there will be internet connection
	
4. 	give the same password as primary router in wireless security. Reconnect with this password after connection is lost. Then change the name of the wifi SSID on extender to be the same as gateway. Do not forget this order

5. 	Change admin password if needed (because of several hard resets done in the above process)
